Name of Project:
PantryPlus.Recipes

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
Provide easy way to find recipes based on what you currently have. Allow you to add items you don’t have to cart.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
•	Kroger authentication/PUT to cart
•	Add personal recipes, mark as private or public to hide or share with site
•	Save current pantry items to your account

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
•	C# and SQL for the back end and authentication
•	I want to see how difficult it will be to learn and use TypeScript
•	JavaScript/jQuery/HTML/CSS for everything front end (possibly not much jQuery if TypeScript works out)

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
•	If the user doesn’t want to authenticate with Kroger, they can still set up an account. In this case, an additional feature would be a shopping list to add all items you need for the recipes you’ve selected that you’re missing. Then you can go to the grocery store and find everything. If the person does use a Kroger grocery store, and still isn’t authenticating with Kroger (or simply doesn’t want to do a curb side pickup), I would be able to sort the items by aisle which makes the shopping experience way easier.
•	Integrate it with a recipe API to get auto suggestions
•	Add an expiration date to items when they’ve been added to the cart, and a pickup has been placed. For example, if a vegetable was added to the cart, it might have an estimated 5 days of shelf life in the fridge. I know that we often buy chicken and can’t always remember when we actually bought it – is it still good then?
•	Recipe suggester based on the minimum amount of work required to make something
•	Recipe suggester based on the minimum price something will cost
•	Mobile friendly interface (this is something that will come naturally with Bootstrap – but I don’t know if I will have time to for sure make everything perfect)
•	On mobile site – get access to camera and scan items from your actual pantry into the site with a barcode reader (super stretch goal). Would make adding 35 spices a lot easier



What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
•	OAUTH2 for authentication with Kroger
•	Lots of Entity, but that’s just part of dotnet
•	Bootstrap
•	Possibly Material by Google (not MUI, as I wont be implementing React into the project) for text boxes, navigation bar, and buttons
•	Figma for page design
•	Photoshop for any logo work
•

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
